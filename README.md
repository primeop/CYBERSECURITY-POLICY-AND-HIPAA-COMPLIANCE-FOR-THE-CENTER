## 📌 Project Overview  
This project provides a **comprehensive cybersecurity policy and HIPAA compliance analysis** for a healthcare-focused bioinformatics center. It evaluates existing policies against **NIST SP 800-66 guidelines** and the **HIPAA Security Rule**, identifying gaps, threats, and vulnerabilities, and recommending **technical, administrative, and physical security controls** to strengthen overall compliance posture.  

---

## 🧭 Objectives  
- Review and compare existing healthcare security policies with **NIST SP 800-66** and **HIPAA requirements**.  
- Conduct a **threat assessment** covering insider, external, and systemic risks.  
- Evaluate and propose **access control models (DAC, MAC, RBAC)**.  
- Recommend additional **administrative, technical, and physical controls**.  
- Develop an **implementation roadmap** with prioritized actions and timelines.  

---

## 🔐 Key Findings  
- **Strengths:** Encryption, defined user roles/groups, HIPAA training, physical access restrictions.  
- **Gaps:** Lack of formal risk assessments, incomplete incident response and disaster recovery, limited workforce security detail.  
- **Threats Identified:** Insider misuse, ransomware, phishing, IoT/IoMT vulnerabilities, weak authentication.  
- **Residual Risks:** Privilege escalation, third-party vendor weaknesses, compliance gaps.  

---

## 🛡️ Recommendations  
- Implement a **formal risk management program** following NIST RMF.  
- Strengthen **access controls** with RBAC and MAC enforcement.  
- Deploy **SIEM monitoring, DLP solutions, and EDR/MDM tools**.  
- Establish **comprehensive disaster recovery & incident response plans**.  
- Enhance **training programs** and vendor security management.  

---

## 📅 Implementation Roadmap  
- **Short Term (0–6 months):** Risk assessment, access control enhancements, workforce training.  
- **Medium Term (6–12 months):** Encryption upgrades, SIEM deployment, vendor management improvements.  
- **Long Term (12–18 months):** Disaster recovery drills, endpoint protection rollout, third-party audits.

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks Used  
- **Standards & Frameworks:** NIST SP 800-66, HIPAA Security Rule  
- **Cloud Services:** AWS (HIPAA-compliant storage, Glacier, CloudTrail, GuardDuty)  
- **Security Models:** DAC, MAC, RBAC  
- **Controls:** Encryption (AES, TLS), IAM, SIEM, DLP, EDR
